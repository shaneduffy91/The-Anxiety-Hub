# The Anxiety Hub

For my first project with Codeinstitute, I have created a website to give people in Ireland more 
information on anxiety disorders. The site is targeted towards Irish people who may suffer
with anxiety and need more information on the disorder and how to get help. The aim of this website is to give the user 
all the information they need about anxiety and how to get help all in one place.

### Features Left to Implement
There are a couple of ideas for future features to be added to The Anxiety Hub.
<ul>
        <li>One idea is to give the user the ability to sign up to meditation apps such as Calm and Aura via an account with The Anxiety Hub. 
        When the user has signed up with The Anxiety Hub, they could choose to subscibe to Calm or Aura or both. </li>
        <li>Another idea is to allow the user to purchase self-help book via the webpage instead of having to go to another webpage to purchase.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a form submitted feature has to be implemented. </li> 
<br>

## Testing
I have tested the website using the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge Browsers on a Windows PC. I can confirm that it works on both.
I have used the Chrome Developer tool to check the website for responsiveness. I can conclude that the website works on different screen 
sizes ranging from Desktop to iphone SE screen sizes.
