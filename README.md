# The Anxiety Hub

For my first project with Codeinstitute, I have created a website to give people in Ireland more 
information on anxiety disorders. The site is targeted towards Irish people who may suffer
with anxiety and need more information on the disorder and how to get help. The aim of this website is to give the user 
all the information they need about anxiety and how to get help all in one place.

        (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).</li>
        <li>There is also a section on the most successful treatment for anxiety disorders, called CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy).</li>
        <li>Finally, we have a scetion on the developer of this website who briefly talks about his own experience with anxiety disorders. </li>
        <li>The material for this page of the website has been sourced from; my.clevelandclinic.org, www.nhs.co.uk and www.hse.ie . </li>

        Dr. David Burns from the USA, who specialises in CBT Treatment for anxiety, and is also a founding member of Team CBT. The second link is to

        </ul>        
</ul>
<br>

### Features Left to Implement
There are a couple of ideas for future features to be added to The Anxiety Hub.
<ul>
        <li>One idea is to give the user the ability to sign up to meditation apps such as Calm and Aura via an account with The Anxiety Hub. 
        When the user has signed up with The Anxiety Hub, they could choose to subscibe to Calm or Aura or both. </li>
        <li>Another idea is to allow the user to purchase self-help book via the webpage instead of having to go to another webpage to purchase.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a form submitted feature has to be implemented. </li> 
<br>


## Testing
I have tested the website using the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge Browsers on a Windows PC. I can confirm that it works on both.
I have used the Chrome Developer tool to check the website for responsiveness. I can conclude that the website works on different screen 
sizes ranging from Desktop to iphone SE screen sizes.
