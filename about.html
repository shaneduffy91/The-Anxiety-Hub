        <h2>Generalised Anxiety Disorder</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Anxiety is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear, that can be mild or severe.
            Everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life. For example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam, 
            or having a medical test or job interview.
            During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal.
            But some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and can often affect their daily lives.

        <h2>Obssesive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) can affect you in different ways. It usually causes a particular pattern of thoughts and behaviours.
    
            <ol>This pattern has 4 main steps:
                <br/>
                <li>Obsession - an unwanted and distressing thought, image or urge repeatedly enters your mind.</li>
                <li>Anxiety - the obsession provokes a feeling of intense anxiety or distress.</li>
                <li>Compulsion - repetitive behaviours or mental acts that you feel driven to perform. These can be a response to the obsessive thought pattern.</li>
                <li>Temporary relief - the compulsive behaviour relieves the anxiety for a short while. But the obsession and anxiety soon return, and the cycle begins again.</li>
            </ol>
           
            It's possible to have obsessive thoughts, with or without the compulsion or urge to act. You may experience both.

        <h2>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)</h2>
        <p>
            C.B.T. can be used in the treatment of many 
            mental health problems such as; depression, anxiety, personality, anorexia, bulimia, addictions, post traumatic stress, and psychotic disorders
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In C.B.T. the person and therapist explores the way that the person’s thoughts, emotions and behaviours are connected and how they affect one another. 
            This allows the person (with assistance, support and guidance from their therapist) to intervene at different points in this 
            cycle and change thought patterns and behaviours which have been problematic for the person.
        </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The person and therapist develop goals together and track progress towards these goals throughout the course of treatment.</li>
                <li>The person and therapist work together – the therapist has the technical expertise, but the person is the expert on him or herself.</li>
                <li>The therapist aims to help the person discover that he or she is capable of changing specific negative thoughts and behaviours.</li>
                <li>Homework is often included. The skills learned in therapy need practice and real life experience.</li>
                <li>C.B.T focuses on present day problems.</li>
            </ul>

        <br>
        <p> "As a sufferer of OCD for many years, I have developed this webpage with the aim of helping people in Ireland who might also have this disorder. 
        It took a lot of courage and strength to admit I had an anxiety disorder and seek the help I needed. I went to my GP and I was reffered to a Therapist qualified
        in CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy). 
        After seeking help, I realised that there was a lack of awareness and information in Ireland for people with anxiety disorders. I suffered for five years before I 
        found out that what I had was a severe anxiety disorder called OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).
        With this website, I hope to give fellow sufferers the direction and guidence needed on the road to recovery."
