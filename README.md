# The Anxiety Hub

For my first project with Codeinstitute, I have created a website to give people in Ireland more 
information on anxiety disorders. The site is targeted towards Irish people who may suffer
with anxiety and need more information on the disorder and how to get help. The aim of this website is to give the user 
all the information they need about anxiety and how to get help all in one place.
